📝 Task List GUI – by Elvis🚀

Simple and clean task manager built with Python and tkinter.  
You can create, view, and delete your daily tasks using an intuitive graphical interface.
This is the upgraded version of my earlier console-based task list.  
Built as part of my AI/Dev journey.

⚙️ Features

- Adds new tasks ✅
- Views all current tasks 📋
- Marks tasks as complete or delete them 🗑️
- Simple and responsive GUI (tkinter)
- Clean, readable code structure (good for beginners)


🧪 How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python 3.12 installed.
2. Copy this repository or download the ZIP file.
3. Run the GUI file on your PC.

python task_list_gui.py


No external libraries required – it’s pure Python + tkinter.
